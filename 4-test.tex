\section{Testing}

The previous section showed that a rigorous definition
of fixed-point arithmetic suitable for use in writing
standards can be written.  That is not surprising.  The
claim of this paper is that machine-checkable specifications
{\it should} be written for appropriate aspects of standards,
because machine checking is {\it needed}.

We can classify errors in a specification as
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Syntax} errors, such as incorrect punctuation,
easily caught by a parser.  Reducing these calls for a
notation that has a checkable grammar.
\item {\it Type} errors, such as calling the wrong function,
or providing the wrong number of arguments, or swapping two
arguments, caught by a more or less capable type checker.
Reducing these calls for a notation that has a statically
checkable type system.
\item Other {\it Semantic} errors, such as swapping two
arguments of the same type, or sign errors.
Reducing these requires a notation that can be executed
in order to run tests, and ideally a testing framework
that makes it easy to write tests.
\end{itemize}

The specification in the previous section is small, but
during its development there were numerous errors of each kind.
